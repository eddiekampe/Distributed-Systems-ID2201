%% The between/3 function will check if a Key is between From and To or
%% equal to To, this is called a partly closed interval and is denoted (F rom, T o].
%% Remember that the weâ€™re dealing with a ring so it could be that From
%% is larger than To. What does that mean and how do you handle it? Also,
%% From could be equal to To and we will interpret this as the full circle i.e.
%% anything is in between.
